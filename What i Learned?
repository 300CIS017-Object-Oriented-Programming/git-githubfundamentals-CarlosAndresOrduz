# :wave: Let them know what you learned and what you are still confused about!

## :octocat: What I learned:

I consider that I learned basic concepts of github, from how to create a repository, a pull request, a Readme file about myself, among other things.

## :octocat: What Im still confused about:

I think I'm still very confused, there were things that I created from trial and error and maybe that's why something changed that I shouldn't have, I entered the repositories of other colleagues to have a general idea, and I think I entered the repository of my partner Sebastian Dow, and I linked or something strange because that repository appears in my profile, in general those are my doubts and concerns.
